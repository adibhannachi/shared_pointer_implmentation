Code based from the official cppreference :
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr

I used the documentation to remplement the shared pointer method , and i did some tested using catch2 library .

USED TOOLS :
	- Visual Studio : as IDE
	- cppchek       : static code analysis
	- cmake         : automate the compilation , generate Makefiles
	- catch2        : unit test library 
        - CLANG         : i used CLANG FORMAT as an extension for VS to format the code
